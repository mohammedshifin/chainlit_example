The document appears to be a case related to an employee, the respondent, who was dismissed from his job by a Cooperative Society (Appellant) in 1983. The respondent was found guilty of several charges, including late attendance, absence without leave, and misconduct.

The respondent filed an application under the Bombay Industrial Relations Act, 1946, seeking reinstatement with back wages and continuity of service. The Labour Court, which was the first court to hear the matter, granted the respondent reinstatement with continuity of service and 50% back wages.

However, the High Court later dismissed the appeal, upholding the Labour Court's decision. The High Court held that the Labour Court had not erred in its decision and that the respondent was not gainfully employed at the time of his dismissal.

The respondent then filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court, challenging the High Court's judgment. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the Labour Court had exercised its discretion fairly and judiciously.

The respondent then appealed to the Appellate Authority, which upheld the Labour Court's decision. The respondent then appealed to the Bombay High Court, which dismissed the appeal.
